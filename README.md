# TicTacToe AI using MINIMAX (PlatformIO-Arduino)
Implementation of the MINIMAX algorithm for tic tac toe on an Arduino.
<br>
This code was run and tested on an UNO (atmega328).
<br>
It uses the serial monitor to interact with the user/gamer.
<br><br>
Feel free to experiment with the code by modifying to to run on different MCUs. ;D
