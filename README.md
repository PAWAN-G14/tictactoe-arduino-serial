# TicTacToe AI using MINIMAX (Arduino-ONLY)
Implementation of the MINIMAX algorithm for tic tac toe on an Arduino.
<br>
This code was run and tested on an UNO (atmega328).
<br>
It uses the serial monitor to interact with the user/gamer.
<br><br>
Feel free to experiment with the code by modifying to to run on different MCUs. ;D
<br><br>
NOTE: This code is undocumeted to keep up the minimalism of this branch.<br>
      For documented code, please, go refer the main repo at https://github.com/PAWAN-G14/tictactoe-arduino-serial.<br>
